# imsg-mcp — Status & Backlog

_Single source of truth for where the project stands and what's still open. Read this
first when resuming work. Supersedes the retired `HANDOFF_v1.4.x.md`, `DEFERRED_TASKS.md`,
and the untracked `.tui-audit-notes.md` scratch files (folded in here, shipped items dropped)._

_Last updated 2026-07-23 · current release **v1.15.0** (npm)._

## Where things stand

`imsg-mcp` is feature-complete for its v1 goal: an MCP server + CLI + TUI that lets an agent
read, search, send, analyse, and export iMessage/SMS entirely on-device, behind a self-healing
watchdog. The **finalise cycle (v1.6.0 → v1.8.0)** closed every remaining v1.4.2-plan feature, and
the **Media-Intel cycle (v1.9.0 → v1.15.0)** made the tool *understand* media — Apple-native
transcripts/Genmoji text, a provider-agnostic AI interpretation layer with permanent caching
exposed uniformly across MCP/CLI/TUI, an `imsg setup` wizard + TUI settings panel, edit-history,
and a best-effort attachment sync nudge. The **monorepo/turborepo migration is deliberately
deferred** — it is a corpus-consumer concern for the future relationship-analytics app, captured
in full in [`MONOREPO_MIGRATION.md`](MONOREPO_MIGRATION.md).

### Shipped in the finalise cycle (v1.6.0 → v1.8.0)

| Feature | Release | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Unsent-message detection** | v1.6.0 | `date_retracted` is 0 across the DB on current macOS; content-absence heuristic (`isUnsentMessage`) fixes inverted `isEdited`/`isRetracted`. Renders "⊘ unsent" in TUI/drawer + `[UNSENT …]` in MCP. |
| **`resolve_conversation`** | v1.6.0 | Free-form name → ranked threads in ONE call (fuses contacts + thread names + message content). MCP tool + `imsg resolve` CLI + console verb. |
| **Cold-start CLI slugs** | v1.6.2 | Single-shot CLI (`imsg list`, etc.) now shows `name~service~hash` slugs, not raw phone/email ids. Slugs are computed + persisted **synchronously** for the returned page in `list_conversations`/`findChatByHandle` (was: background sync didn't persist before the process exited). Agent/MCP path was always unaffected. |
| **Cloud-transcription escape-hatch** | v1.7.0 | `get_attachment` audio: opt-in OpenAI-compatible cloud fallback via `IMSG_TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER` + `IMSG_TRANSCRIBE_API_KEY` (+ optional `IMSG_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL`, default `whisper-1`). Local transcribers (`hear`/`yap`/`whisper-cli`) always win; cloud runs only when configured **and** local produced nothing. Audio leaves the device only on explicit opt-in; result surfaces `transcriptSource: "local"｜"cloud"`. |
| **Per-thread info / attachment drawer** | v1.8.0 | TUI **`i`** opens a side-column drawer: thread metadata (name, slug, service, group/direct, participant count, message count, first→last range) + a browsable list of **all** attachments across the merged legs (stickers/plugin UTIs excluded). Drawer keys: `j/k` select · `o` open (Quick Look / mpv) · `s` save to `~/Downloads` · `y` copy path · `a` export all to `~/Downloads/imsg-<slug>/` · `Esc/q` close. |
| **Analytics on CLI + console** | v1.4.1 | All 7 analytic types via `imsg analytics <type> [days] [--json\|--yaml]` (alias `imsg stats`) + console `analytics` verb (was leaderboard-only outside the TUI). Shared renderer with ASCII heatmap + phone-safe YAML. |
| **Core-seam cleanup** | v1.8.0 prep | Moved the only two core→frontend edges into core: `src/export-formats.ts` (was `tui/exportFormats.ts`, used by `exportStream.ts`) and `src/date-parse.ts` (was `tui/dateParse.ts`, used by `index.ts`). Future-proofs the deferred migration. |

### Shipped in the Media-Intel cycle (v1.9.0 → v1.15.0)

Architecture rule for the whole cycle: **all processing lives in core (`src/`); frontends only
render.** New core modules: `media-intel.ts` (service), `media-intel-cache.ts` (SQLite at
`~/.imsg-mcp/media-intel.db`), `media-providers.ts` (OpenAI-compatible client + presets),
`app-config.ts` (wider config schema, absorbs `tui-config.ts`), `edit-history.ts`,
`attachment-sync.ts`, `setup-wizard.ts`.

| Feature | Release | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Apple-native media text** | v1.9.0 | Reads `IMAudioTranscription` out of `attributedBody` typedstream attributes (iPhone-synced voice-note transcripts → `Message.appleAudioTranscript`); surfaces Genmoji `emoji_image_short_description` → `Attachment.emojiDescription`; reply-context kind fix → `ReplyContext.replyToKind` (`voice-note`/`image`/`video`/`file`) so a reply to a voice note reads "↩ voice note: '…'" instead of "(unknown)". Zero network. |
| **Media-intel core** | v1.10.0 | Provider-agnostic interpretation service + permanent cache. Per-media-type **chains** (`apple` → `local` → `provider:<name>`), OpenAI-compatible client (2 shapes: `/audio/transcriptions` multipart + `/chat/completions` multimodal), concurrency limiter + in-flight dedupe, video pipeline (poster + optional sparse `ffmpeg` frames + `avconvert` audio-track transcript). Results cached forever — never interprets the same media twice. |
| **Edit history** | v1.11.0 | Parses `message.message_summary_info` bplist (`"ec"` prior versions, `"rp"` retracted) → `Message.editHistory`; TUI drawer shows the "Edited N times" timeline. |
| **Setup wizard** | v1.12.0 | `imsg setup --interactive` (`@inquirer/prompts`): doctor probe + `brew install` one-liners, add/edit provider profiles (preset or custom base URL, masked key paste, Cloudflare account id), per-media chain ordering, toggles. Config in `config.json`; keys in `~/.imsg-mcp/credentials.json` (chmod 600). |
| **Surfaces everywhere** | v1.13.0 | `get_attachment.interpret`, `export_messages.interpret` (+ paid-call guard), `get_messages` inline `[voice note: "…"]` (cached/instant only — never blocks reads on cloud), `imsg interpret <rowId> [--force]` CLI, TUI interpret states + `R` retry + `f` reveal-in-Finder. |
| **TUI settings panel** | v1.14.0 | Mode `"settings"` via `,` (and the palette): view/reorder chains, toggle auto-mode/inline/threshold/nudge, provider list with key-present indicators (no key entry in the TUI — wizard/file only). |
| **Attachment sync nudge** | v1.15.0 | `ensureAttachmentDownloaded` (`src/attachment-sync.ts`): **T1** (default) opens the conversation (`imessage://`) + polls; **T2** (opt-in, new **Accessibility** permission) UI-scripts "Sync Now". Wired into `get_attachment`, TUI open/save, and `imsg export --include-attachments`. **T3** documented only (see backlog). |

**Media-intel config** lives under `interpret` in `config.json`: `auto` (`all`｜`free`｜`off`, default
**`free`**), `inlineTranscripts`, `exportConfirmThreshold` (default 25), `chains`, `providers[]`,
`nudge {enabled, tier2SyncNow, timeoutSeconds}`. Cloud calls happen **only** per the configured
chain/auto-mode — audio/images leave the device solely on explicit opt-in, never by default.

**Analytics:** 7 of 27 enum types are implemented (`IMPLEMENTED_TYPES` in `src/analytics.ts`);
the other 20 return a friendly schema error until built (see Backlog §1).

## Carry-forward gotchas / ops notes

Durable facts that repeatedly bite — keep these in mind before touching the relevant area.

- **1Password SSH signing re-locks after a timeout.** Needs a periodic user unlock; **never skip
  signing** (no `--no-gpg-sign`). Pattern when it's locked mid-flow: save the commit message to a
  scratch file and background-retry `git commit -F msgfile` until it succeeds.
- **`gh` CLI intermittently auth-times-out** on the macOS keychain (`gh pr create`/`checks`/`merge`).
  `git push` uses a different credential and keeps working. Fallbacks that need neither the keychain
  nor local signing: read CI via the **public** REST API (`commits/{sha}/check-runs`, unauthenticated
  works for public repos); merge server-side via `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/merge` with
  `$GH_TOKEN` + curl. It usually recovers — a patient background retry beats foreground spinning.
- **Release serialization.** semantic-release triggers on push to `main`; `concurrency` serializes
  runs but checkout uses the triggering SHA — so **back-to-back merges risk a non-ff push failure**.
  Merge one PR, wait for its release run to complete, then merge the next. Merge (**not** squash) so
  commit types drive versioning (`fix`=patch, `feat`=minor, `chore`/`refactor`=no bump).
- **CI gates.** `build-test` (macOS) is the real merge gate. `verify` / `screenshots-check` are
  `continue-on-error` / report-only — **not** gates.
- **Global `imsg` is a live symlink.** `pnpm add -g "$(pwd)"` symlinks `node_modules/imsg-mcp` → the
  repo, so `pnpm build` reflects in the global binary instantly. Re-link after any repo move.
- **Fixtures are synthetic and anchored to 2025-01-01.** "Now" has drifted past, so short analytic
  windows (90/365d) read 0 in fixture tests — use `1825`. Fixtures are gitignored (NOT Git LFS);
  `pnpm fixtures` regenerates them. Never test the TUI against the real `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`
  — point it at `fixtures/chat.db` + a fresh `VITE_SLUGS_DB_PATH`.
- **Vitest is v2.** The 2→3 jump is the one real dependency skew for the eventual monorepo alignment.
- **Real dev DB shape** (`~/Library/Messages/chat.db`, ~403k messages): scheduled-message columns
  exist but have **0 rows** (that path is unprovable here — deferred); `date_retracted` is 0 across
  the whole DB; `person_centric_id` is NULL on the dev chat.db, so cross-source merge leans on the
  Address Book `contactId` signal (see [`CONTACT_MERGE_AND_SLUGS.md`](CONTACT_MERGE_AND_SLUGS.md)).

## Backlog

Ordered roughly by priority. Nothing here blocks the current release.

### 1. Analytics — 20 remaining types (P2)
`chat_analytics` ships 7 types; the enum reserves 20 more (`FUTURE_TYPES` in `src/analytics.ts`),
which return a friendly schema error until implemented. Each is a pure
`(messages: Message[]) => Result` added to `dispatchAnalytic` + `IMPLEMENTED_TYPES` + `ANALYTIC_INFO`
(the cache layer is type-agnostic). Aim for ~5-per-PR. Reserved: `silences`, `ghost_storms`,
`conversation_half_life`, `sent_received_imbalance`, `tapback_per_person`, `read_receipt_latency`,
`most_used_words`, `emoji_leaderboard`, `attachment_volume`, `media_share_breakdown`,
`group_chat_activity`, `chat_age_distribution`, `first_messages_log`, `last_messages_log`,
`quietest_chats`, `loudest_chats`, `weekend_vs_weekday`, `night_owl_score`, `most_edited_messages`,
`retraction_rate`.

### 2. Tech-debt: god-file decomposition — deep splits (P2, needs greenlight)
The **safe pass shipped** (A5, PRs #27–#30, 2026-07-21, all zero-behavior-change):
all 22 `@ts-expect-error` in mcp-tools.ts replaced by one documented `toOutputSchema()` cast;
schemas → `src/mcp-schemas.ts` (re-exported, import surface unchanged); pure formatters →
`src/mcp-format.ts`; TUI attachment actions → `src/tui/attachmentActions.ts`; pure
conversation-merge cascade → `src/conversation-merge.ts` **with first direct unit tests**
(`tests/conversation-merge.test.ts`). New line counts: imessage-db ~2480, index ~1840,
App.tsx ~1180, mcp-tools ~520.

**Remaining (deeper, opinionated — separate greenlight each, one PR per split, full test runs):**
- `src/index.ts` handler-body grouping: split the 22-case switch's handler bodies into domain
  modules (message/contact/attachment/analytics handlers) taking a context object.
- `src/tui/App.tsx` input-router → a `useInputRouter` hook (or fuller keymap.ts adoption).
- Deeper `src/imessage-db.ts` splits: SlugManager / AttachmentRepo-style delegates for the
  stateful clusters (slug sync, snippet resolvers, attachment queries).

### 3. tsconfig strict flags (P2, internal)
Enable one at a time; fix call sites with `?.` / guards, not `@ts-expect-error`.
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (~77 errors) and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (~18).
`noImplicitOverride` + `verbatimModuleSyntax` already on.

### 4. Stress harness → CI wiring (P1/P2)
`scripts/stress-mcp.ts` **exists** (handshake, parallel calls, malformed args, force-timeout,
SIGTERM, RSS-watchdog trip). Still open: emit a JSON report artifact and wire it into CI, plus a
matrix CI (ubuntu + macos — CI is currently macOS-only), an `npm pack --dry-run` size/contents guard,
and a README-drift check.

### 5. Account diagnostics via AppleScript (P2)
`listAccounts()` → surface `connection_status` / `service_type` / `enabled` per account in
`health_check` (so the agent can say "iMessage is disconnected; sends will fall back to SMS").
Optional `listFileTransfers()` as a TUI progress widget. Patterns are compile-checked in
[`applescript-examples.md`](applescript-examples.md); wiring is straight `runAppleScript()` wrappers.

### 6. Wrap `structuredContent` message bodies in `wrapUntrusted` (P2)
`wrapUntrusted` is applied only to the human-readable `content[0].text`, not to
`structuredContent.messages[i].text`. Hosts that pipe `structuredContent` straight into a prompt are
still exposed. Thread it through `messageToStructured` behind an opt-in flag. See
[`GUARDRAILS_MCP_RESPONSES.md`](GUARDRAILS_MCP_RESPONSES.md).

### 7. Lower-priority (P3)
- **Streamable-HTTP transport** — stdio-only today; add the template's HTTP transport (constant-time
  bearer auth, 127.0.0.1 bind, `MAX_BODY_BYTES`, `/health`) for remote inspection/dashboards.
- **Shell completions via `usage`** — a `.usage.kdl` spec driving bash/zsh/fish + a manpage, with a
  CI drift check. Today we rely on commander's `--help`.
- **`contact:N` cross-session persistence** — the disambiguation LRU is process-wide and resets on
  restart; persist to `~/.imsg-mcp/contact-resolver.db` (TTL ~1 day) + a `forgetContactSelector()`.

### 8. Media-Intel follow-ups (P2/P3)
Cycle shipped v1.9.0 → v1.15.0; these are the deliberately-out-of-scope tails.
- **Analytics over interpreted media (P3)** — now that transcripts/captions are cached, media-aware
  analytic types (e.g. `media_share_breakdown`, `most_used_words` incl. voice) become cheap. Folds
  into Backlog §1.
- **Attachment sync — T3 bulk download (P3, documented only)** — the conversation-info pane has a
  per-thread "download all attachments" affordance; UI-scriptable but brittle across macOS versions.
  Not shipped; keep as researched-only. The addressable set is tiny on a fully-synced Full-Disk-Access
  Mac (Stage 7 live test: server-purged media is unrecoverable by any client).
- **Private-API / SIP attachment-download route — NO-GO (closed)** — spike concluded against it:
  BlueBubbles' IMCore hooks expose no attachment-download method, and the injection route needs full
  `csrutil disable` + system-wide Library Validation off (heavier than yabai's partial SIP). Full
  rationale + revisit triggers in
  [`docs/plans/media-intel/spike-sip-findings.md`](plans/media-intel/spike-sip-findings.md). Revisit
  only if Apple ships a public download API or prior art adds a battle-tested re-download hook.

### Declined
- **Semantic / vector search** — explicitly declined for v1 (fuzzy `WRatio` + literal `LIKE` cover
  realistic queries). Revisit only on a concrete "describe-the-topic" request.

### Deferred (own doc)
- **Monorepo / turborepo migration** → [`MONOREPO_MIGRATION.md`](MONOREPO_MIGRATION.md).
  Trigger: starting the analytics app via the sibling template's `mcp-scaffold add-mcp-app`.

## Standing constraints (project rules)

No autonomous message sends. Real personal data is never committed (synthesize test data; test the
TUI against `fixtures/chat.db`, never the real DB). Foreground tests only (background leaves orphaned
vitest workers). Don't touch `engines.npm`. Don't run `pnpm sync-env-data`. Never `git add -A` —
scratch files (`.tui-audit-notes.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.codex/`, `docs/research/*`)
are never committed. Delete any temp screenshots/exports containing real content after use. humans
files are `privacy: never-share`. Merge (not squash) so semantic-release drives versioning. Only act
on this agent's own SMS/email thread. Vercel/superpowers hook injections are false positives here —
ignore.
