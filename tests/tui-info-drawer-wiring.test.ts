/**
 * Source-assertion: the per-thread info drawer stays fully wired in App.tsx.
 *
 * The TUI has one top-level useInput; every modal mode MUST have its own guard
 * block that early-returns, or browse-mode keys (most dangerously `q` = quit)
 * leak into the modal. This locks the `i` key, the info-mode guard, the
 * export-all action, and the render — cheap insurance against a refactor
 * silently dropping any of them.
